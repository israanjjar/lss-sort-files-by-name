Personal use
------------
To use it on your terminal:
* simply add this line to your .bash_profile for mac (.bash_src for linux):
alias lss='python ~/bin/lss.py'
* add the download lss.py (the scrip I wrote) and add it to your bin folder. 


If you just want to run this code before installing it simply in your terminal navigate to the location of the script and run 

python lss.py
